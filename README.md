# DBEditor


DBEditor is a Unity editor window that for organizing ScriptableObject Assets, that contains a flexible hierarchy tree, a handy toolbar and an integrated inspector.
The library is managed from a ScriptableObject asset with a list of objects describing hierarchies and types.

It was initially created during 2017, while working on a project that had a very complex, rigid and troublesome editor for the same purpose. I was not allowed to allocate time to replace it, so I did it on my free time and donated it to the project. Resulted a very handy tool, that have been using on my projects ever since.
